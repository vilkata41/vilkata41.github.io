## This summer...

*I wanted to do something different.<br>
I wanted to challenge myself. <br><br>*

To see if I can improve with drastic changes in the difficulty of my projects.<br>
To see how far I can go with as little help as possible.<br>
```SPOILER!``` It wasn't easy but I made it in the end.<br><br>

This story begins in the end of Year 1 in university... One of our tutors saw potential in me and four other boys and offered to give us each a project **(way more difficult than those given to us in university)**, to monitor us, and to give us help if we truly needed it. All of this for free!<br><br>

So in the beginning of the summer all of us got our projects in detail. That's how the notion about ```TweetFiltered``` was born.<br>
Storytime's over, let's get factual...<br><br>
