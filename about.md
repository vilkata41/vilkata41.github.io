I am a second year student in University of Strathclyde, Glasgow. I have been enthusiastic on creating innovative software in the areas of AI, Java development, and Python development.
I am currently working on a project that takes use of the Twitter API, processes certain posts with media, detects faces, and applies filters to them. Finally, the product is posted back on Twitter.

### More Information

I wrote my first book when I was 17 and created a mini-game when I was 17 as well. When in university, I was interested in one of my tutors' proposals to start working on different projects that are out of the curriculum and that would help me for later.
I am currently learning by practice.
